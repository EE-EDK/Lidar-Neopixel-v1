LiDAR RP2040 Controller Field ManualThis manual provides a comprehensive overview of the LiDAR RP2040 Controller, a dual-core system designed for precise distance and velocity measurements. The controller uses a high-speed LiDAR sensor and continuously monitors for configurable trigger conditions, activating an output on TRIG_PULSE_LOW_PIN (GPIO16) for a duration of 3 seconds. The firmware, version v6.3 Dual-Core Architecture, features enhanced performance and robust functionality.Key FeaturesDual-Core Operation: Core 0 manages high-speed LiDAR communication (up to 1000Hz), while Core 1 processes data and system logic.GUI Configuration: Real-time configuration via a serial interface.NeoPixel Status Display: Visual feedback for distance (heat map), velocity (saturation), trigger events (white flash), and system status.Enhanced Performance: Features adaptive velocity calculation with noise filtering and supports 800Hz/1000Hz operation modes.LittleFS Storage: Stores non-volatile configuration settings with checksum validation.Thread-Safe Operation: Utilizes mutex-protected inter-core communication and atomic buffer operations.2. GUI Configuration SystemThe controller can be configured via a serial interface. To enter configuration mode, you must power on the device and send any character to the serial terminal within a 15-second window. The NeoPixel will change from a blue breathing pattern to a purple flashing pattern to indicate that the device is in configuration mode.Configuration CommandsThe GUI uses a packet-based protocol with a format of 0x7E [CMD] [LEN] [PAYLOAD...] [CHECKSUM].CommandFunctionPayload'S'Get system statusNone'D'/'d'Get/Set distance thresholdsPosition (0-7), Value (cm)'V'/'v'Get/Set velocity thresholdsType ('m'/'x'), Position, Value'M'/'m'Get/Set trigger mode1=Distance only, 2=Distance+Velocity'G'/'g'Get/Set debug output0=Disabled, 1=Enabled'W'Save configurationNone'R'System resetNone'F'Factory resetNone3. Dual-Core Operation FlowCore 0: LiDAR Communication & Data AcquisitionThis core is responsible for high-speed sensor communication and data buffering.Initializes the LiDAR sensor at 460800 baud for high-speed operation.Sets the frequency to 800Hz or 1000Hz based on the configuration.Validates incoming data frames before inserting them into a circular buffer.Monitors for communication timeouts and performs graduated recovery.Core 1: Data Processing & System LogicThis core handles all data processing and user interaction.Pulls data frames from the atomic buffer for processing.Calculates velocity using median filtering across a 15-frame history.Evaluates trigger conditions (distance and velocity) with debouncing and a 3-second latch.Manages the NeoPixel display, GUI commands, and configuration storage.Monitors physical configuration switches.5. ConfigurationThe device's behavior is configured via physical switches and the GUI. The trigger output (TRIG_PULSE_LOW_PIN) is an active-low signal that activates when an object meets the configured distance and, if enabled, velocity thresholds.Trigger Logic SummaryDistance Check: The object's distance is less than or equal to the configured threshold.Velocity Check: (If enabled) The object's velocity is within the set min/max range.Debouncing: A 30ms on-delay and 50ms off-delay prevent false triggers from noise.Latching: Once triggered, the output remains active for a 3-second duration.6.
